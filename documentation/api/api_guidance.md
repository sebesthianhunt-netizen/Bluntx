# BLVKDOT API Guidance

- All endpoints must conform to RESTful standards.
- Use JWT or OAuth2 for authentication.
- Standardize error responses.
- All fields and responses must be documented in OpenAPI.
- Use versioning for breaking changes (e.g., /v1/).
- See `openapi.yaml` for schemas and examples.
